This thesis focuses on building a radio-controlled car powered by STM32 microcontrollers. It describes the development of both the car and transmitter, presents hardware parts and their utilization, and explains the control software in detail.

The controlling system was developed from scratch on top of an old Tamiya chassis and consists of a custom-made control board with modules and necessary control software. The chassis was modified and equipped with more powerful BLDC motor. In order to retrofit the transmitter, a custom PCB was designed. In addition to the essential functions, the car features various sensors and modules with the ability to log the data to the micro SD card. Also, the car status is reported back to the transmitter and visualized on an OLED display.

The developed RC system is tested in real conditions at the end of the thesis. Besides, the maximum controllable range and top speed are measured.
