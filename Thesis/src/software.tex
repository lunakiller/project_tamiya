The control program for both the transmitter and the car is written in C language. It utilizes the STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) libraries, and the STM32CubeMX graphical utility was used to set up the necessary initialization and project files and generate code for peripheral configuration.

STM32 HAL driver library provides a set of APIs to simplify interaction with all the peripherals and thus the user application implementation. The HAL driver layer implements run-time failure detection to increase robustness. HAL APIs are available for all peripherals. Also, the API ensures high portability across different STM32 families \cite{hal}.

STM32CubeMX is a graphical tool that provides a convenient user interface to configure the microcontroller. It allows a simple configuration of peripherals and clock-tree and generation of corresponding initialization C code. It also packs middleware stacks, such as USB, FatFs, or TCP/IP. This tool notably speeds up the process of microcontroller configuration and allows the user to focus on the application \cite{cubemx}.
